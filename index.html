        <p class="blog-content">
          Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a
          source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for
          Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging,
          syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code
          refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard
          shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.
          In the Stack Overflow 2022 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was
          ranked the most popular developer environment tool among 71,010
          respondents, with 74.48% reporting that they use it.

        <p class="blog-content">
          Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its
          design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
          significant indentation via the off-side rule. Python is dynamically
          typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
          paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural),
          object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
          "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
          library.

        <p class="blog-content">
          JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
          one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
          webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
          web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
          users' devices.

        <h3 class="blog-title">NODE JS</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can
          run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end
          JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and
          executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets
          developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
          server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the
          server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the
          page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
          represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying
          web-application development around a single programming language, as
          opposed to using different languages for the server- versus
          client-side programming.

          MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented
          database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses
          JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by
